### USAGE

To create a slider, just include the Slider.h into your .h file, add the delegate <SliderDelegate> and a property for the Slider. See the SliderDemo for examples.

### TYPES OF SLIDER
You can (currently) have two types of slider, one which provides the percentage of the sliders, and one which provides a fixed value back to your delegate. Both are shown in the SliderDemo.
